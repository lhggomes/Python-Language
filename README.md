Getting Started
---------------
This a repository to store algorithms and utilities for python language. Here are some information how to create classes, connect with database, use threads, order a list and etc.
I use this as a memory book, to use when is needed. 


Installing
----------

From source
~~~~~~~~~~~

Use Git to get the latest development version from our gitlab
repository:

.. code:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/lhggomes/python-language.git

You'll need a Git client. The command line program is fine, but if you
prefer graphical interface, you can install e.g. git-gui on Linux. 
~~~~~~~~~~~

Built With
----------

Using Python


Versioning
----------

We use `Git<http:www.github.com/lhhgomes>`__ for versioning. For the
versions available, see the `tags on this
repository <https://github.com/lhggomes/python-language.git>`__.
